# barebones-pyo3-example
A very simple pyo3 example with notes to help people understand pyo3 features. This feature demonstrates creating a class with methods, as well as stand alone functions and passing both to Python. Pyo3 is reliant on using the nightly version of Rust, so make sure this is installed and being used for build.

`rustup install nightly`

# Building and installing
To make things easier, I recommend installing pyo3-pack to generate a wheel, then using pip to install it. 

`cargo install pyo3-pack`

or

`pip install pyo3-pack`
