# barebones-pyo3-example
A very simple pyo3 example with notes to help people understand pyo3 features. This feature demonstrates creating a class with methods, as well as stand alone functions and passing both to Python.

# Building and installing
To make things easier, I recommend installing pyo3-pack to generate a wheel, then using pip to install it. 

`cargo install pyo3-pack`

or

`pip install pyo3-pack`
